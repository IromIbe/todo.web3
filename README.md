Hiii!
Thank you for stopping by. This is my very first decentralized project.

In this project, i learnt how to interact with smart contracts from my frontend.
I used remix for writing my smart contract, and used ethers.js to interact with the frontend.

Overall, i think i did well.
my todo dApp can Add task, delete a particular task, clear all task edit a particular task.
mark a complted task.

And yes, I didn't give you a shabby UI.

check out my project here https://todo-web3.vercel.app/. Tell me what you think. Feel free to reach out to me at irommyibe@gmail.com
